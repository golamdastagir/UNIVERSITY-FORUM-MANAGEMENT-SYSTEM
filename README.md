## Goals:

Our primary objectives for this project are as follows:

2. Provide assistance to new students, helping them become comfortable with the university and courses.

3. Offer a convenient way for individuals to retrieve lost items on campus.

We hope this system enhances the university experience and fosters a sense of community among its members.
